a
computer
system
for
transformational
grammar
a
comprehensive
system
for
transformational
grammar
has
been
designed
and
implemented
on
the
ibm
360/67
computer
the
system
deals
with
the
transformational
model
of
syntax
along
the
lines
of
chomsky
s
aspects
of
the
theory
of
syntax
the
major
innovations
include
a
full
formal
description
of
the
syntax
of
a
transformational
grammar
a
directed
random
phrase
structure
generator
a
lexical
insertion
algorithm
an
extended
definition
of
analysis
and
a
simple
problem-oriented
programming
language
in
which
the
algorithm
for
application
of
transformations
can
be
expressed
in
this
paper
we
present
the
system
as
a
whole
first
discussing
the
general
attitudes
underlying
the
developm
